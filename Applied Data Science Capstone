A description of the problem and a discussion of the background

I live in Rome and I would like helping a friend that is a talented chef. He is able to cook differente kind of cousine, and his
best talent is cooking meat. So he asked me to help him finding the best place in Rome wher opening a restaurant, and according his
talent what is the best kind of restaurant.

Of course I have to analyze how many restaurants there are in Rome , in each Municipio (Roma's Neighboor) and the cost for a rent
a location in the area.
So first of all I need a Dataset with the coordinates of the Municipi and I need also the distribution and the kind of restaurants 
in Rome divided by Municipio. I am going to use the Foursquare API to create this dataset. I also need some info about the price of 
a rent in each Municipio. Another constraint will be the distance from the city center, because near we get the place bettere is.
