INTRODUCTION
I live in Rome and I would like helping  my friend that is a talented chef to pen a restaurant. He is able to cook differente kind of cousine, and his
best talent is cooking meat. So he asked me to help him finding the best place in Rome where opening a restaurant, and according his
talent what is the best kind of restaurant.

So I have to analyze how many restaurants there are in Rome , in each Municipio (Roma's Neighboor) and the cost for a rent
a location in the area.
So first of all I need a Dataset with the coordinates of the Municipi and I need also the distribution and the kind of restaurants 
in Rome divided by Municipio. I am going to use the Foursquare API to create this dataset. I also need some info about the price of 
a rent in each Municipio. Another constraint will be the distance from the city center, because near we get the place bettere is,
for the number of tourists.

DATA
I got the data of the MUNICIPI on an old dataset I had for a university's work, wherein there are information about the center in terms of 
coordinates of each MUNICIPIO and the mean of the price for a rent at MQ.
I used Foursquare API to get the information about the kind of restaurant.

METHODOLOGY
My idea is to create a vector associates to each MUNICIPIO wherein I rappresent the relative frequency of each restaurant's type.
So I will subtract this frequency from 1 to get the opposite value, so I will able to create a vector with some value at 1 (the type of restaurant
i would like to open, and 0 for the ones I don't care) and sum it two value (from 0 to 1) that rappresent the weigh of Price or DIstance
in that MUNICIPIO.

RESULT and CONCLUSION
So after this analysis I get that if you want to open a Steakhouse the best place wherein open a restaurant should be the 11th MUNICIPIO.
